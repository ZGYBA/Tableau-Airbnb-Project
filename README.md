# Tableau AirbnbChicago Visualization Project 
CST2106 Data Visualization Topics, April 2022

• Identified correlations between various social, economic, and demographic factors and overall Airbnb performance in 77 Chicago community areas with the emphasis on location. This will help business owners to evaluate future Airbnb operations.

• Discovered diversity in each region and noticeable trends, for example, downtown Chicago has a higher number of spots creating a high gap compared to less popular areas. The number of spots and price is proportional to income and population. The number of new hosts peaked in 2015, 2016 but decreased in 2020 due to COVID. Superhost, amenities are unique to each region, but downtown area has few parking spots despite being a more populated area.
